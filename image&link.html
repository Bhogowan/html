        <p>As the pandemic hit us, our reality has taken a drastic change. 
            The world has moved a pace forward towards using more technology.
            At this point, the approach of action has turned from physical to digital.
            Now meetings are no more preferred on physical presence, but a laptop with a good internet connection will do the task. 
            Social consumption has also increased immensely. The necessity of being indoor has caused a rise in the average screen time of humans hence increasing the requirement of more content, which has led the content creators to become more transparent about their lives to keep up with the increasing demand for spicy content.</p>
